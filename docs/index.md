### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/csabagabor/Execution-History-Recorder--Intellij-IDEA-Plugin/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
